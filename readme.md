# API Design: Think First, Code Later

This is the code form the talk I gave at the first Pyzza Floripa (09/03/17).    
The slides are [here](https://speakerdeck.com/jonatasbaldin/api-design-think-first-code-later). And the blog post the talk was based, [here](https://www.ckl.io/blog/api-design-think-first-code-later/).

You can render the Blueprint code in [Apiary](https://apiary.io/) or with  [Aglio](https://github.com/danielgtaylor/aglio).

You can run the Python[3] tests with:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python tests.py
```
